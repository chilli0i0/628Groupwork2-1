"VADER-Sentiment-Analysis", a nice method included in the 'nltk' library.

Reference:
1. Hutto, C.J. & Gilbert, E.E. (2014). VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text. Eighth International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM-14). Ann Arbor, MI, June 2014.

Noticeable thing that I should try:

* "If you have access to the Internet, the demo will also show how VADER can work with analyzing sentiment of non-English text sentences."
